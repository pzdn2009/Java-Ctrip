# Threadpool source code

## TP Status

```java
The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
 private final AtomicInteger ctl = new AtomicInteger(ctlOf(RUNNING, 0));
     //整数位表示: 32 - 3 = 29
private static final int COUNT_BITS = Integer.SIZE - 3;
//2^29 - 1
private static final int CAPACITY   = (1 << COUNT_BITS) - 1;

// runState is stored in the high-order bits 分别乘
private static final int RUNNING    = -1 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int SHUTDOWN   =  0 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int STOP       =  1 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int TIDYING    =  2 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int TERMINATED =  3 << COUNT_BITS;

// Packing and unpacking ctl 
private static int runStateOf(int c)     { return c & ~CAPACITY; }
private static int workerCountOf(int c)  { return c & CAPACITY; }
private static int ctlOf(int rs, int wc) { return rs | wc; }

/*
 * Bit field accessors that don't require unpacking ctl.
 * These depend on the bit layout and on workerCount being never negative.
 */

private static boolean runStateLessThan(int c, int s) {
    return c < s;
}

private static boolean runStateAtLeast(int c, int s) {
    return c >= s;
}

private static boolean isRunning(int c) {
    return c < SHUTDOWN;
}
```

* **一共五个状态**：RUNNING，SHUTDOWN\(showdown方法触发\)，STOP\(showdownNow方法触发\)，TIDYING\(一个中间状态，等待线程数和任务数为空\)，TERMINATED
* **两个指标**：线程数和任务数

## Execute method



```java
public void execute(Runnable command) {
    if (command == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
       
       /*
         * Proceed in 3 steps:
         *
         * 1. If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, try to
         * start a new thread with the given command as its first
         * task.  The call to addWorker atomically checks runState and
         * workerCount, and so prevents false alarms that would add
         * threads when it shouldn't, by returning false.
         *
         * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we still need
         * to double-check whether we should have added a thread
         * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
         * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
         * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
         * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
         *
         * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
         * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
         * and so reject the task.
         */

    int c = ctl.get();
    
    if (workerCountOf(c) < corePoolSize) {
        if (addWorker(command, true))
            return;
        c = ctl.get();
    }
    
    //isRunning(c), check the TP status.
    if (isRunning(c) && workQueue.offer(command)) {
        int recheck = ctl.get();
        // if TP status is not running, then try to remove and reject
        if (!isRunning(recheck) && remove(command))
            reject(command);
        // if is running, add to non-core worker.
        else if (workerCountOf(recheck) == 0)
            addWorker(null, false);
    }
    else if (!addWorker(command, false))
        reject(command);
}
```

大致分三个步骤 :

1. 当前运行的线程数量是否小于corePoolSize，直接尝试addWorker\(\) 
2. 往阻塞队列里面放入Runnable任务 
3. 如果入队失败，直接尝试addWorker\(\)

## 

## Worker

```java
/**
 * Class Worker mainly maintains interrupt control state for
 * threads running tasks, along with other minor bookkeeping.
 * This class opportunistically extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
 * to simplify acquiring and releasing a lock surrounding each
 * task execution.  This protects against interrupts that are
 * intended to wake up a worker thread waiting for a task from
 * instead interrupting a task being run.  We implement a simple
 * non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock rather than use
 * ReentrantLock because we do not want worker tasks to be able to
 * reacquire the lock when they invoke pool control methods like
 * setCorePoolSize.  Additionally, to suppress interrupts until
 * the thread actually starts running tasks, we initialize lock
 * state to a negative value, and clear it upon start (in
 * runWorker).
 */
private final class Worker
        extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
        implements Runnable
        
    {
        /**
         * This class will never be serialized, but we provide a
         * serialVersionUID to suppress a javac warning.
         */
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 6138294804551838833L;

        /** Thread this worker is running in.  Null if factory fails. */
        final Thread thread;
        /** Initial task to run.  Possibly null. */
        Runnable firstTask;
        /** Per-thread task counter */
        volatile long completedTasks;

        /**
         * Creates with given first task and thread from ThreadFactory.
         * @param firstTask the first task (null if none)
         */
        Worker(Runnable firstTask) {

            this.firstTask = firstTask;
            this.thread = getThreadFactory().newThread(this);
        }

        /** Delegates main run loop to outer runWorker  */
        //代理方法
        public void run() {
            runWorker(this);
        }

        // Lock methods
        //
        // The value 0 represents the unlocked state.
        // The value 1 represents the locked state.

        protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
            return getState() != 0;
        }

        protected boolean tryAcquire(int unused) {

                return true;
            }

        public boolean tryLock()  { return tryAcquire(1); }
        public void unlock()      { release(1); }
        public boolean isLocked() { return isHeldExclusively(); }

        void interruptIfStarted() {
            Thread t;
            if (getState() >= 0 && (t = thread) != null && !t.isInterrupted()) {
                try {
                    t.interrupt();
                } catch (SecurityException ignore) {
                }
            }
        }
}
```

* 继承AQS，需要使用acquiring和releasing a lock
* 非重入锁
* 自定义中断实现
* 构造函数：创建Runnable的线程

## AddWorker

```java
private boolean addWorker(Runnable firstTask, boolean core) {
    retry:
    for (;;) {
        int c = ctl.get();
        int rs = runStateOf(c);

        // Check if queue empty only if necessary.
        // 线程池状态
        if (rs >= SHUTDOWN &&
            ! (rs == SHUTDOWN &&
               firstTask == null &&
               ! workQueue.isEmpty()))
            return false;

        // 线程数量范围
        for (;;) {
            int wc = workerCountOf(c);
            if (wc >= CAPACITY ||
                wc >= (core ? corePoolSize : maximumPoolSize))
                return false;
            if (compareAndIncrementWorkerCount(c))
                break retry;
            c = ctl.get();  // Re-read ctl
            if (runStateOf(c) != rs)
                continue retry;
            // else CAS failed due to workerCount change; retry inner loop
        }
    }

    // addWorker
    boolean workerStarted = false;
    boolean workerAdded = false;
    Worker w = null;
    try {
        w = new Worker(firstTask);
        final Thread t = w.thread;
        if (t != null) {
            final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
            mainLock.lock();
            try {
                // Recheck while holding lock.
                // Back out on ThreadFactory failure or if
                // shut down before lock acquired.
                int rs = runStateOf(ctl.get());

                if (rs < SHUTDOWN ||
                    (rs == SHUTDOWN && firstTask == null)) {
                    if (t.isAlive()) // precheck that t is startable
                        throw new IllegalThreadStateException();
                    workers.add(w);
                    int s = workers.size();
                    if (s > largestPoolSize)
                        largestPoolSize = s;
                    workerAdded = true;
                }
            } finally {
                mainLock.unlock();
            }
            if (workerAdded) {
                t.start();
                workerStarted = true;
            }
        }
    } finally {
        if (! workerStarted)
            addWorkerFailed(w);
    }
    return workerStarted;
}
